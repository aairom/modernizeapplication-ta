## DataCollection for the Analysis and Modernization Task
In this lab, you access WebSphere Application Server to review the deployment of the Mod Resorts application. To identify which Java EE programming models are on the server, you could run the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool against the server. The Transformation Advisor creates an inventory of the content and structure of each app and learn about problems that might occur if you move the app to cloud. Finally, you review the analysis reports to determine the complexity of the move-to-cloud efforts and select the migration candidate app.

Here are the activities involved in this process:

The following two tasks are optional and require a demo account to access the Websphere Application.  To go through these tasks, please follow 6.1 and 6.2 in the full lab:
*https://www.onlinedigitallearning.com/mod/page/view.php?id=74202*
* Log in to WebSphere Application Server to review the deployed apps
* Start and run the Mod Resorts application in web browser
* Run the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool against the WebSphere Application Server to get application data

Note: this lab will start by importing the data previously gathered about the WebSphere Application.
* Import the data collection tool output.
* Review the analysis reports that Transformation Advisor generates to identify if the application is a right candidate for rapid and cost-effective migration to cloud.
